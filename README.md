gtksourceview-themes
====================

Themes I created for text apps using gtksourceview.
These themes are not really complete but are good enough for HTML/PHP/CSS and
Python.


Content
-------

 * Gluesque : Dark theme with cool and flashy colors.
 * Gmate : Dark theme inspired by TextMate.
 * Orangeade : Orange theme.


Installation
------------

Put every XML files in /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0 (Gnome 2) or /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0 (Gnome 3).
I recommand to put them in /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0 and link them to /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0


Have fun !
